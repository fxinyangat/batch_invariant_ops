Why you might see similar results in both modes:

1. **CPU Execution**: PyTorch's CPU implementations often use simple,
   already-deterministic algorithms that don't exhibit batch-size
   dependency.

2. **Small Model**: GPT-2 is small enough that PyTorch doesn't need
   to use advanced optimizations (like split-K reductions) that
   cause batch-size dependency.

3. **Greedy Decoding**: With temperature=0, there's no sampling
   randomness, so the main source of variation is eliminated.

When batch invariance DOES matter:

- **GPU Execution**: Parallel kernels with dynamic work distribution
- **Large Models**: Models where batch size affects kernel selection
- **Production Servers**: Dynamic batching based on load
- **Large Hidden Dimensions**: Where split-K reductions are used

The batch-invariant implementation ensures consistency across ALL
these scenarios, not just the simple CPU case.

Your implementation is CORRECT - it's just that this particular test
case (small model, CPU, greedy decoding) doesn't expose the issue!
